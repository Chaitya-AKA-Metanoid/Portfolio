# **App Name**: Skyscraper Story

## Core Features:

- Cityscape Rendering: Render a 3D cityscape of Mumbai using Three.js and React.js.
- Camera Animation: Animate the camera's movement through the 3D city based on the user's scroll position using React.js. Include a smooth descent, pans, and zooms.
- Building Animations: Trigger lighting and unique animations for each project building as the user scrolls to its section using React.js. Different animations could include light beams, drones, and holograms.
- Project Cards: Display project information (title, description, links) in clean, modern UI cards that slide in as the user scrolls to each project building using React.js.
- Contact Indicators: Use neon signs on buildings at street level to represent contact methods (LinkedIn, GitHub, email) using React.js. Display contact details on hover.
- Dynamic Environment: Use a generative AI tool to automatically update the city's lighting and weather conditions to match the current conditions in Mumbai. The LLM will use a tool to determine the current weather.
- Journey Highlight: On the final scroll, highlight the buildings that the user has previously visited by fully illuminating them to visually demonstrate the completed tour using React.js.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, muted Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of night in a vibrant urban setting. The choice is informed by the original request for a night time atmosphere and an overarching 'city' concept.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212), close to black, but subtly visible.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#BF00FF), an analogous color to the primary indigo, but brightened and saturated for contrast in the city lights.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif. The combination provides a balance of futuristic and readable text elements appropriate for digital architecture.
- Use glowing, minimalist icons for contact information. Match the stroke weight to the neon sign aesthetic.
- Project cards should have a clean, modern design. Use a semi-transparent background to maintain visibility of the cityscape behind the cards.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations throughout the scroll experience. Animations must not distract from the project details.
